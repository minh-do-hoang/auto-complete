# AutoComplete  
 (This bug of their website has been submitted to Hanoi Department of Education and Training and has been patched before this repository was published.)  
 
 1. Download and unzip.
 2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and enable Developer mode.
 3. Click on **Load unpacked**, then select the folder you've unzipped to in step 1. 
 4. You should only enable it after you've logged in to your account on the site (but nothing will break if you haven't).
 5. Everything is automated:
  - It'll look at your history to determine which tasks you've done
  - It'll then automatically select the next available task (or do nothing if none is left)
  - It'll then complete everything and wait 10 - 20 minutes to submit your work
  - Repeat.
  
Basically, **you can leave the tab alone and it'll do everything by itself**.
