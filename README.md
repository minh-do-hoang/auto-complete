 9.8 gpa ez game  

 1. Download and unzip 
 2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and enable Developer mode 
 3. Click on **Load unpacked**, then select the folder you've unzipped to in step 1. 
 4. You should only enable it after you've logged on to the site (but nothing will break if you don't) 
 5. Everything is automated:
  - It'll look at your history to determine which tasks you've done
  - It'll then automatically select the next available task (or do nothing if none is left)
  - It'll then complete everything and wait 10 - 20 minutes to submit your work
  - Repeat.
  
Basically, **You can leave the tab alone and it'll do everything by itself**.

~~*(Optional features include randomizing so that there are wrong answers, and disabling auto selection. Click on branch and select the corresponding option to choose them if you want to)~~
